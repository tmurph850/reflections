  you always need to initialize a repository so you are able to utilize the benefits of git in your directory.

2*How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

.The staging area is different from the working directory and the repository, It is an area where you can see which files
are going to be saved in your next commit. The repository is the collection of files within your working directory which you have
chosen to be linked together, the working directory is the location where all these files, even the ones you do not have linked are located.
